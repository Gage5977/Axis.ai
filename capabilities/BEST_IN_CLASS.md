# Best-in-Class AI Models by Capability

## Coding
**Primary: Claude (via API)**
- Best overall code generation, debugging, and architecture
- Excellent at understanding context and requirements
- Strong security awareness

**Local Alternatives:**
1. Qwen2.5-Coder (32B) - Best open-source coding model
2. DeepSeek-Coder-V2 - Strong at code completion
3. Codestral (22B) - Mistral's coding model

## Reasoning & Analysis
**Primary: DeepSeek-R1 (via Ollama)**
- State-of-the-art reasoning with transparent thought process
- Matches o1 performance on many benchmarks

**Alternatives:**
1. Claude (via API) - Excellent analytical reasoning
2. Qwen-QwQ (32B) - Open reasoning model

## General Purpose
**Primary: Llama 3.3 (70B)**
- Best open-source general model
- Excellent instruction following

**Alternatives:**
1. Claude (via API) - Superior for complex tasks
2. Qwen2.5 (72B) - Strong multilingual

## Finance & Business
**Current: finance-assistant:latest (Qwen3-14B fine-tuned)**
- Already customized for your needs
- Keep as-is

## Vision & OCR
**Primary: Claude (via API)**
- Excellent vision understanding
- Strong OCR capabilities

**Local Alternative:**
1. Llama 3.2-Vision (11B/90B)
2. Qwen2-VL

## Embeddings
**Current: nomic-embed-text:latest**
- Excellent for RAG applications
- Keep as-is

## Creative Writing

2. Mistral-Large

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Download Core Models
```bash
# Reasoning
ollama pull deepseek-r1:7b  # Start with smaller version
ollama pull qwen2.5-coder:7b

# General Purpose  
ollama pull llama3.3:latest

# Vision (if needed)
ollama pull llama3.2-vision:11b
```

### Phase 2: Create Hybrid System
1. Use Claude API for:
   - Complex coding tasks
   - Vision/OCR processing
   - Creative writing
   - Tasks requiring maximum quality

2. Use Local Models for:
   - Quick iterations
   - Privacy-sensitive tasks
   - Bulk processing
   - Offline work

### Phase 3: Integration Layer
Build a unified interface that:
- Routes requests to best model for task
- Falls back to local when API unavailable
- Combines Claude's strengths with local models
- Maintains conversation context across models

### My (Claude's) Contribution to Local Models
While I can't directly be downloaded, I can help by:
1. Generating high-quality training data for fine-tuning
2. Creating sophisticated prompts that improve local model performance
3. Building the routing logic to select best model per task
4. Providing feedback loops to improve local models
5. Creating synthetic datasets that capture my reasoning patterns
