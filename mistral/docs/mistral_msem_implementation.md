    """
    def __init__(self, input_dim=4096, num_experts=8, top_k=2):
        self.input_dim = input_dim
        self.num_experts = num_experts
        self.top_k = top_k  # Number of experts to activate
        
        # Learned gating network
        self.gate_network = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(input_dim, 2048),
            nn.SiLU(),
            nn.Linear(2048, num_experts)
        )
        
        # Load balancing loss
        self.load_balance_loss = 0.01
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # Compute routing scores
        scores = self.gate_network(x)
        
        # Select top-k experts
        top_k_scores, top_k_indices = torch.topk(scores, self.top_k)
        
        # Normalize scores
        top_k_scores = F.softmax(top_k_scores, dim=-1)
        
        return top_k_indices, top_k_scores
```

        self.hidden_dim = hidden_dim
        self.capacity = expert_capacity
        
        # Specialized transformer layers
        self.layers = nn.ModuleList([
            TransformerBlock(
                hidden_dim=hidden_dim,
                num_heads=128,

                specialized=True
            ) for _ in range(48)  # Deeper than base model
        ])
        
        # Expert-specific embeddings
        self.expert_embed = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(1, hidden_dim))
        
    def forward(self, x, routing_weight):
        # Add expert-specific signal
        x = x + self.expert_embed
        
        # Process through specialized layers
        for layer in self.layers:
            x = layer(x)
            
        # Weight by routing score
        return x * routing_weight.unsqueeze(-1)
```

        self.router = MSEMRouter(hidden_dim, num_experts)
        
        # Initialize diverse experts
        self.experts = nn.ModuleList([
            self._create_expert(expert_type) 
            for expert_type in [
                "code", "math", "language", "reasoning",
                "multimodal", "scientific", "creative", "general"
            ]
        ])
        
        # Aggregation layer
        self.aggregator = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        # Get routing decision
        expert_indices, expert_weights = self.router(x)
        
        # Activate selected experts
        expert_outputs = []
        for idx, weight in zip(expert_indices, expert_weights):
            expert_out = self.experts[idx](x, weight)
            expert_outputs.append(expert_out)
            
        # Aggregate expert outputs
        combined = torch.stack(expert_outputs).sum(dim=0)
