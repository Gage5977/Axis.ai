# Enhanced Mistral Architecture Design (2025)

## Core Architecture Components

### 1. Massive Sparse Expert Models (MSEMs)
- Implement conditional computation where only relevant expert modules activate
- Design with 671B parameters (matching DeepSeek-R1) but only 10-20% active per query
- Create specialized expert modules for:
  - Code generation
  - Mathematical reasoning
  - Natural language understanding
  - Multimodal processing
  - Scientific analysis

### 2. Advanced Reasoning Layer
- Implement chain-of-thought reasoning similar to o1/o3
- Add internal "thinking" tokens that aren't shown to user
- Create multi-step problem decomposition
- Target 85%+ accuracy on IMO-level mathematics
- Include self-verification loops for consistency

### 3. Extended Context Architecture
- Design for 256K base context window
- Implement sliding window attention for efficiency
- Add hierarchical memory system for 2M+ token capability
- Use parallel attention mechanisms for speed

### 4. Native Multimodal Processing
- Unified encoder for text, images, video, audio
- Cross-modal attention mechanisms
- Separate expert modules for each modality
- Seamless modality switching without performance degradation

### 5. Speed Optimization Techniques
- Target 1200+ words/second generation
- Implement speculative decoding
- Use KV-cache optimization
- Parallel token generation where possible
- Optimize attention mechanisms for speed

### 6. Self-Improvement Architecture
- Built-in data augmentation pipeline
- Synthetic example generation
- Online learning capabilities (with safety constraints)
- Automated performance monitoring and adjustment

### 7. Deployment Flexibility
- Full precision weights (no quantization)
- Modular architecture for selective loading
- Support for distributed inference
- Maintain open-source compatibility
- 4-8 GPU deployment options

## Key Differentiators from Current Mistral

1. **Sparse Activation**: Unlike dense models, only activate needed experts
2. **Reasoning First**: Built-in reasoning capabilities, not bolted on
3. **True Multimodality**: Not just text with image support, but native multimodal
4. **Speed Leader**: Faster than any current model including Le Chat
5. **Context King**: 256K standard, 2M+ with hierarchical memory
6. **Self-Improving**: Learns and adapts (safely) over time

## Technical Specifications

- **Parameters**: 671B total, 67-134B active per query
- **Context**: 256K tokens standard, 2M+ extended
- **Speed**: 1200+ words/second
- **Modalities**: Text, Image, Video, Audio, Code
- **Deployment**: 4-8 GPU minimum, distributed capable
- **Precision**: Full FP16/BF16 (no quantization)
